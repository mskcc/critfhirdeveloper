If you would like to request access to data for a research study at MSK, please send a request to rtmcritds@mskcc.org. Authentication is based on the Client Credentials grant. This means that clients will need to generate an access token and supply it in the headers of each request being made. Once you are established as a partner, you\u2019ll be given a client_id and a client_secret , which you will use for generating tokens and using them to make authenticated requests to the server. Protocol Access All data access is restricted on a per protocol basis. It is assumed that incoming requests to Blaze always contains a researchstudy parameter, which identifies what research study the client is requesting data for. This information is used in combination with the researchstudy parameter to authorize requests. Generating Access Tokens POST /msk-apim/external/msk-oidc/oauth2/token This endpoint is use to to generate an access token, access tokens must be included in all resources endpoints.

It is good practice not to return all data, by default we are capping the number of resources to fifty; however, this number is configurable via a parameter _count. We advise keeping this default value to prevent database timeouts. Paging is presented via the link Bundle attribute. The link attribute identifies the Links related to this Bundle. In the figure above there are total of 87 resources, and it set to only return 50 resources. In order to obtain the remaining 37 records, the \"relation\" : \"next\" json object must be used to read the value of the computed URL value.
